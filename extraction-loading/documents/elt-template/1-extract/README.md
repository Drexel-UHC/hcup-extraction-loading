# 1-extract

Note that for now we will not partition by year and file. This fodler contains the extraction codebase for the years and file-types of the SID database. At extraction completion there are three file types.

- `.acs` - is the raw data file from HCUP
- `.dta` - is the extracted data file in Stata format
- `.Do` - is the extraction codebase in Stata format
